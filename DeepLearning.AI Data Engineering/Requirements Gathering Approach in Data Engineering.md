### Requirements Gathering Approach in Data Engineering

2. **Key Elements of Requirements Gathering:**
   - **Identify Existing Systems and Pain Points:**
     - Understand what systems are currently being used and the challenges stakeholders face with these systems.
     - Example: The data scientist mentioned daily data dumps from the software team, which is suboptimal because it leads to outdated data and cumbersome manual processing.

   - **Learn Actions Stakeholders Plan to Take:**
     - Ask stakeholders what they want to achieve with the data provided, not just what they need.
     - This helps in understanding the business context and aligning the data system requirements accordingly.
     - Example: The marketing team wants real-time analysis to make informed decisions about marketing campaigns.

   - **Confirm Understanding:**
     - Reiterate what you have learned to the stakeholders to ensure that you have captured the requirements accurately.

   - **Identify Additional Stakeholders:**
     - Determine if there are other stakeholders you need to speak to for a complete understanding of the requirements.
     - Example: Speak with the software engineering team to understand data ingestion options and any potential schema changes.

3. **Application to the Mock Conversation:**
   - The video uses the mock conversation with the data scientist to highlight how these elements were applied.
     - **Current System:** The data scientist receives daily data dumps, causing delays and manual processing overhead.
     - **Pain Points:** Data cleaning takes up 80% of their time, and schema changes disrupt workflows.
     - **Planned Actions:** The marketing team wants real-time data, but "real-time" needs to be clarified (e.g., within seconds, hours, or days).

4. **Importance of Clarifying "Real-Time":**
   - Stakeholders often use terms like "real-time" loosely. Understanding the specific actions they want to take based on the data helps define how quickly data needs to be served.

5. **Next Steps for the Data Engineer:**
   - Follow up with additional stakeholders (e.g., marketing and software engineering teams) to refine requirements and define technical specifications.
   - Plan for solutions that automate data ingestion, transformation, and serving, meeting both functional and non-functional requirements.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Effective requirements gathering involves identifying existing systems and pain points, understanding stakeholder actions, confirming understanding, and identifying other stakeholders.
   - These steps form a solid foundation for building data systems that meet business needs and provide value.

This video emphasizes a structured approach to gathering and defining requirements for data systems, ensuring alignment between technical solutions and business objectives.
