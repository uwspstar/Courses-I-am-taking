### Framework for Thinking Like a Data Engineer

2. **Four Stages of the Framework:**
   
   1. **Stage 1: Identify Business Goals and Stakeholder Needs**
      - **Objective:** Understand high-level business goals and identify key stakeholders.
      - **Actions:**
        - Have conversations with stakeholders to understand their needs and what actions they plan to take using the data.
        - Identify existing systems, their limitations, and what improvements are needed.
      - **Outcome:** A clear understanding of business goals and a list of stakeholder needs tied to those goals.

   2. **Stage 2: Define Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
      - **Objective:** Translate stakeholder needs into concrete functional and non-functional requirements.
      - **Actions:**
        - Functional requirements: Describe what the system must do (e.g., data ingestion, transformation).
        - Non-functional requirements: Define technical specifications (e.g., latency, performance).
        - Confirm these requirements with stakeholders to ensure alignment.
      - **Outcome:** A documented set of requirements to guide system design.

   3. **Stage 3: Choose Tools and Technologies**
      - **Objective:** Select the best tools and technologies to meet the defined requirements.
      - **Actions:**
        - Identify multiple tools that can meet each requirement.
        - Perform a cost-benefit analysis, considering factors like licensing fees, cloud costs, and maintainability.
        - Choose the best components and create a prototype.
      - **Outcome:** A set of tools and a tested prototype to validate the design.

   4. **Stage 4: Build, Deploy, and Monitor the System**
      - **Objective:** Build the final data system based on the chosen tools and deploy it for production use.
      - **Actions:**
        - Continuously monitor system performance and gather feedback from stakeholders.
        - Iterate on the system to accommodate changing business needs and incorporate new technologies.
      - **Outcome:** A fully functional, evolving data system that meets stakeholder needs.

3. **Importance of Prototyping and Iteration:**
   - Before building the full system, test a prototype to ensure it meets expectations and provides value.
   - Continuously iterate and improve based on stakeholder feedback and changing business requirements.

4. **Cyclical Nature of the Process:**
   - Although presented as sequential stages, the process is ongoing and cyclical.
   - Data systems need to evolve with changing business goals and stakeholder needs, making communication and iteration crucial.

5. **Application Throughout the Course:**
   - The framework will be revisited throughout the course as you go through each stage in depth.
   - In Week 4, the process will be applied to a practical project where youâ€™ll gather requirements, select tools, and implement a data architecture based on those requirements.

This framework serves as a guideline for data engineers to effectively design, implement, and maintain data systems that align with business goals and stakeholder needs.
