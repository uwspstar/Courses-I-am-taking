### System Requirements

1. **Definition of Requirements:**
   - **Business Requirements:** High-level goals of the business, like increasing revenue or expanding the user base.
   - **Stakeholder Requirements:** Needs of individuals within the organization that help them perform their tasks effectively.
   - **System Requirements:** What the system needs to do (functional requirements) and how it should do it (non-functional requirements).

2. **Types of System Requirements:**
   - **Functional Requirements (What):** Describe what the system needs to achieve. For example, providing regular updates to a database or alerting users about data anomalies.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements (How):** Technical specifications related to ingestion, orchestration, storage, security, and performance.

3. **Requirement Gathering Process:**
   - Start by having conversations with stakeholders to understand their needs, goals, and constraints.
   - Translate these business and stakeholder needs into technical requirements for the system.
   - Consider additional constraints such as cost, security, and regulatory requirements.

4. **Challenges in Gathering Requirements:**
   - Stakeholders may not express their needs in the form of concrete system requirements.
   - It’s the data engineer’s role to bridge the gap between business goals and system functionality.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Understanding how to communicate with stakeholders of varying technical backgrounds.
   - Optional conversations with experts like Sol Rashidi and Jordan Morrow provide further insights into effective requirements gathering.

The focus is on gathering and translating stakeholder and business needs into actionable system requirements, forming the foundation of any data engineering project.
