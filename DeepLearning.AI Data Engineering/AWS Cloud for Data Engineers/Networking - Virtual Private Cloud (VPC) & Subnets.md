### Summary: Networking - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) & Subnets

#### 1. **What is a Network?**
   - A **network** is a collection of devices connected together that can send and receive requests or responses. In cloud computing, networks enable communication between resources and with the outside internet.

#### 2. **What is an IP Address?**
   - An **IP (Internet Protocol) address** is a unique identifier for a device within a network. It ensures correct routing of data between devices.
   - **IPv4 Address:** The most commonly used IP version, expressed as a 32-bit integer in the format `x.x.x.x` (e.g., `192.101.0.2`), where each `x` is a number between 0 and 255.
   - **CIDR Notation:** Stands for **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**. It represents a range of IP addresses for a network and helps optimize IP address allocation. An example is `192.101.0.0/24`, which represents the range of IP addresses from `192.101.0.0` to `192.101.0.255`.

#### 3. **What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?**
   - A **VPC** is an isolated private network within AWS where users can launch and manage resources like EC2 instances. It provides an added layer of security and control by isolating resources from the outside world.
   - **Key Characteristics:**
     - Exists within a region and can span multiple availability zones (AZs).
     - Provides a way to create and manage resources with specific IP ranges.
     - Default behavior: Resources within a VPC can communicate, but there's no communication with external networks or other VPCs unless configured.

#### 4. **What is a Subnet?**
   - A **subnet** is a smaller network inside a VPC. It divides the VPC’s IP address range into segments for better organization and control.
   - **Purpose:** Subnets allow for more granular access control to resources.
     - **Public Subnets:** Allow external traffic to access resources.
     - **Private Subnets:** Restrict external access to resources.
   - Each subnet is assigned its own CIDR block, which must be a subset of the VPC’s CIDR block.

#### 5. **Key Concepts:**
   - **VPCs and Subnets** enable detailed control over cloud networking configurations, allowing users to manage access and isolate resources.
   - Resources in different subnets within the same VPC can communicate with each other because they belong to the same VPC.
   - Understanding VPCs and subnets is essential for creating secure, scalable, and well-organized cloud architectures.

This summary provides an overview of the basic networking components on AWS, such as VPCs and subnets, and explains key concepts like IP addresses and CIDR notation.

#### 4. **Question:** How do you assign IP addresses to subnets in a VPC?
   **Answer:**
   - When creating a subnet, you assign it a **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** block, which is a subset of the VPC’s CIDR block. Each subnet’s CIDR block must not overlap with others in the same VPC.

   ```python
   # Example: Creating a VPC and a subnet using Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
   import boto3

   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
   
   # Create a VPC
   vpc = ec2.create_vpc(CidrBlock='10.0.0.0/16')
   print(f"VPC Created with ID: {vpc['Vpc']['VpcId']}")

   # Create a subnet within the VPC
   subnet = ec2.create_subnet(VpcId=vpc['Vpc']['VpcId'], CidrBlock='10.0.1.0/24')
   print(f"Subnet Created with ID: {subnet['Subnet']['SubnetId']}")
   ```

   | **Feature**              | **AWS (CIDR Block)**                  | **Azure (CIDR Block)**                  | **GCP (CIDR Block)**                   |
