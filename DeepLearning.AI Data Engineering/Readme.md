### "Introduction to Data Engineering" Course

1. **Course Overview:**
   - A brief introduction to the course and its objectives.
   - Definitions and scope of data engineering.

2. **History of Data Engineering (Optional Video):**
   - Evolution of data engineering from traditional software engineering.
   - How data engineering emerged as its own field as the value of data increased over time.

3. **Role of Data Engineers:**
   - Data engineers were originally software engineers focused on building software applications.
   - Their role evolved to include building systems for data ingestion, storage, transformation, and serving.

4. **Data Engineering Definition:**
   - Data engineering involves developing, implementing, and maintaining systems and processes that transform raw data into high-quality, consistent information for downstream use cases, such as analytics and machine learning.

5. **Data Engineering Lifecycle:**
   - The lifecycle starts with data generation from source systems and progresses through stages like ingestion, transformation, storage, and serving.
   - Data storage is integral to each stage and supports the lifecycle.

6. **End Use Cases:**
   - Stakeholders use transformed data for analytics, machine learning, and other business applications like Reverse ETL.

7. **Data Pipeline:**
   - The data pipeline is a collection of architectures, systems, and processes that move data through various stages of the lifecycle.
   - It covers getting raw data, transforming it, and serving it for different use cases.

8. **Undercurrents of Data Engineering:**
   - Six key components influence all stages of the lifecycle:
     1. **Security**
     2. **Data Management**
     3. **DataOps**
     4. **Data Architecture**
     5. **Orchestration**
     6. **Software Engineering**

9. **Thinking Like a Data Engineer:**
   - It's crucial to think holistically about the entire data engineering lifecycle and how each component fits together to provide value.

10. **System Requirements and Conversations:**
    - Understanding system requirements and translating stakeholder needs into specific requirements.

11. **Week 1 Overview:**
    - In-depth discussions of the data engineering lifecycle, the role of data engineers, and how to derive business value from data.
